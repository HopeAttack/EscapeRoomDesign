                     “Born into Flames” is the title of an indie film directed by Lizzie Borden. The movie is set in New York City ten years after the Wars of Liberation. The Wars of Liberation was a peaceful socialist revolt in America that led to creation of a socialist democracy. This new form of governing was supposed to provide equality for all but the “rich only got richer and the poor wait on their dreams.” In response to the false promises and failures of the government, different groups can be seen revolting in the film. “Born in the flame” follows one of these groups called the women’s army. The women’s army is a group of women that advocates for equal rights and treatment for all women regardless of class, sexuality and race.  <br/><br/>
                    At first glance I didn’t grasp or understand the significance of the women’s army. It wasn’t until I read, “The Master Tools Will Never Dismantle the Masters House” by Audre Lorde , that I could see that the army was engaging in intersectional second wave feminism. Second wave feminism was a period of social activism by woman during the 1960’s. The predecessor to the second wave feminism, was the first wave. The first wave mainly focused on legal issues such as women’s rights to vote. Second wave feminism advanced this fight for women’s rights by critiquing the patriarch of male dominated intuitions and social norms surrounding women. In the film the women army holds a protest where some women are asked why they are there. One woman said she was there because she had worked a job for certain amount of year but there were no opportunities for her to move up in the company. Another woman said she was at the protest because of her treatment at work. Her boss treated her like an office wife. Commanding her to fetch him this and make him coffee. These reasons for protesting reflect second wave feminism.
  
                
                    
                     
                     
                     <br/> <br/>
                     The “intersectional” part of intersectional second wave feminism refers to a system of inequality based on race, class, gender and sexual orientation. These forms of discrimination are inseparable factors that oppress women. Without taking these factors into consideration, “only the narrowest parameters of change are possible and allowable”.  “Born into flames is indicative of intersectional second wave feminism because we watch the feminist fight from the perspective of the women “who stand outside of the circle of society definition of acceptable.” These women are those “who are poor, who are lesbian, who are black and who are older.” These women are the leaders of the women army. The head activist Adelaide Norris, played by Jean Satterfield, was a black poor lesbian woman. Her mentor Zella Wylie, played by Florynce Kennedy was an older black woman. Lizzie Borden creates these characters to highlight how much harder the fight for women right are for these women. At the start of th film no one was willing to help the women’s army. They were turned down by Radio host, Honey and Radio Ragazza went they ask for help in spreading information about the army. They were also turned down by the editors of the Socialist Youth Review. I believe they were unwilling to help because they had not yet realized that the forms of oppression, they faced were all interlinked. They saw the armies’ issues as their problem instead of a problem for all women.

             Failure to include the struggles and oppression all women face only leads to incomplete policy and narrow windows of progression. After the women’s army had asked for their assistance, journalist from The Socialist Youth Review voiced their opinion about the group on The Belle Gayle Show.  They commented on how the rape and prostitution are not that bad and the government has set up a structure that is willing to accommodate the needs of the women. They view the women’s army as an intitled group driven by the trill of revolution. The journalist have these views about the women’s army because the socialist government works form them. The journalist are unable to understand the struggles the women’s army is fighting against because they are not bound by the same oppressive factors of discrimination. Lorde refers to this as trying to use the master tools to dismantle the master house. The journalist are using the tools of the classist and sexist government to examine the fruits of that same government. Lorde says that “the master tools will never destroy the master house. They may allow us to beat him at his own game but, they will never be able to bring about genuine change.” This consequence is seen in the film when president issues a statement that women will now be paid for house work. This may seem to be a victory for women, but this only reinforces the master house, the government. Nothing would have change for the oppressed woman in the movie. Thankfully women of the army realized the statement from the president was just a way to draw their attention away from the death of Adelle Norris. So, they kept up with the revolution. Eventually the army was able to unite the women in the city. The unified group of women moved to more radical forms of protest ending the film by bombing a building. 
               <br/><br/>Ultimately, I believe that born into flames functions as propaganda. Propaganda is the exaggeration of biased information in order to influence public opinion. This film tries to accomplish this by creating a socialist society that still oppresses women. By having them film take place in this setting I believe that Lizzie Borden is trying to say that no form of government will provide women equal rights. Not even a social one. Women will only be treated equally when they take their liberation into their own hands. “Born into film” is a call to action for women to wake up and become aware of the short comings of their governing intuition and act radically to bring about true change.  Although this is Borden goal, I believe that film does not accomplish this. The film hits a turning point with the death of Adelle Norris. This is when the different groups of women unite and start radically revolting against the government. This drive to now act doesn’t transfer to the anyone watching the movie. In order for, the audience to be moved by Addle death I believe Borden should have built up her character more in the movie. Her death would have been way more impactful if we had more time to know and understand
her as a character. The most we learn about Addle comes from the brief of the FBI officers. If this film would have been able to compel to the audience emotions more through Addle’s death I would have given it a good rating. But lack of connection to the character makes her death not as impactful to the audience. Overall, I give the film a 2 out of 5.
