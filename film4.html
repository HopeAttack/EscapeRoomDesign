                    Don Hertzfeldt’s World of Tomorrow is a three part series that starts when a toddler named Emily is visited by future clones of herself.  The clones live in a future where they have achieved an imperfect state of immorality. Transhuman technology has allowed a version of someone to exist forever by having their memories and consciousness uploaded into a clone of themselves. Repetition of this process causes the clones to be unstable and deteriorated. Longing to be complete, the clones bring Emily Prime, the original Emily to future or travel to the past to extract what they need from her.  As they wait for their extractions to finish they take Emily on an internal and external tour of their lives and how they have been shaped by a transhuman dystopia they call home.   <br/><br/>
           As mentioned earlier, the process of immorality creates clones that have serious defects. One of Emily clones had a “deep longing for something she couldn’t remember”. She “ often found herself burden by memories that were not hers”. Every other clone from their timeline also suffered this way, creating the dystopia presented in the film.  This dystopia is labeled transhuman because technology has changed the ideal of a human in “World of tomorrow”. Transhuman are defined as “beings whose basic capabilities so radically exceed those of present humans as to no longer be unambiguously human by our current standards.” Transhumanists envision these new capabilities gained from technology as a positive, but Hertzfeldt present a world where the enhancements present negative consequences. The clones have the capability to relive memories. This causes them to dwell in the past, and not live for what today has to offer. They also have time travel allowing people travel in between time and commit murders undetected.    <br/><br/>
  
                
                               
                     
                     Although we don’t have time travel or have figured out how to clone people, we do have technology that has allowed us, humans, to exceed basic human capabilities. Our cell phones give us the capabilities to see anyone and almost everything regardless of distance. Airplanes give us the ability to travel at speeds up to 500 miles per hour. Medical devices are created every day that prolong our lives. I don’t think out technology has advanced enough for us to be considered transhuman like the clones of The World of Tomorrow but we are trending towards their dystopia. Social media has similar effects on us that memory had on the clones. Memories of good times in the past caused the clones to compare their lives to the life of Emily Prime. Emily Prime lived in a world similar to ours regarding technological advances and the condition of earth. The Clones, on the other hand, live in a post-apocalyptic world, where Earth had been struct by a meteor. The differences in the two worlds cause the clone’s emotional distress. This same emotional stress can be seen in our time with social media. Like Memories in “The world of Tomorrow”, social media serves as the medium  used to compare lives to each other. This causes people to focus on what they don’t have and makes everyone think that the next man’s life is better than their. The clones only feel emotional distress over the good memories Emily Prime possessed. This compares to how we only feel distress over the good side of people presented on social media.

  Aside form all the talk about technology and transhumanism, I believe that Hertzfeldt is trying say something about growing up. In the first two episodes we learn about the dystopia the clones live in as they explain it to a young Emily Prime. Emily Primes obliviousness  to the problems of the future is a something found with youth. Children don’t understand the gravity of the problems the world faces. As Emily Prime receives bad  news about the future she replies with phases such as “ I ate lunch today” or she would do things such as count the dead bodies of the discount time travelers floating in space. At the end of day after she has received all the depressing news about the future she say “what a happy day it is”. Her reflects the obviousness of youth. Children are only concerned with the present. Socially opinions, pressure, and constraints have yet to burden them.

  Episode two of the series represents the teenage year of life. Emily 6, the clone that visits Emily Prime in the second episode is going a transition. She must find out who to be, since she can’t be the copy of the next generation of Emilie’s. In addition to this she has a defect that make it hard for her to process emotions. The things Emily 6 is going through can are similar to what teenagers go through as they grow up. Emily 6 says “My mind was young and idealistic like yours then I grew up”. As we grow up we start to learn more about our currently reality and it can be depressing. Emily 6 was depressed by her reality until she visited the imagination of Emily Prime. While there Emily 6 was able to live out her dream and perform the nutcracker. Sadly, we do not possess the technology to visit the imagination of other but we do have drugs that give us a similar experience. Drugs function like Emily Primes imagination, by offering an escape from the societal burdens. Similarly, to Emily 6, teenagers also struggle with emotions as they go through puberty.

  Episode three of the series is reminiscent of what adulthood is like. We are introduced to Emily’s lover David Prime. David Prime reality is lifeless and dull. There were no colorful scenes filled with light, only a dark and bleak setting. David’s life is plagued with choices and responsibilities. As he goes on his quest to find the message Emily’s clone leaves him, he constantly has to make choices to give up things such as the capability to enjoy music in order to gain storage to continue on his quest. This symbolizes growing up to me. As adults we learn that every choice has consequences, and we must pick and choose what has to be sacrificed in order to get us to our desired destination. David also had an issue with his view screen where ads constantly pop up. It seemed to be some sort of virus. The virus represents the daily problems you face as an adult that never seem really go away.

                       <br/><br/>       Overall, I thought the world of tomorrow was terrible. I thought the first two episodes were leading to something bigger than what episode three had to offer. It seemed as if Hertzfeldt ran out of money and put together an ending that didn’t really make sense to me. Also I felt that there were to many hidden messages, making it unclear what the bigger picture was.  I give the film a 1 out 5, it wasn’t even visually appealing.
