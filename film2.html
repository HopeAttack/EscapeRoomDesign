                    Her by Spike Jonze is a somewhat romantic movie that follows the life of Theodore, in a not-so-distant future. Theodore is a lonely, socially awkward middle-aged male, whose job is to write handwritten letters. Through the letters Theodore is able to convey love, passion and raw emotion, for others. His relationship on the other hand, has failed, leaving him an emotional wreck. In efforts to fill the void cause by the heartbreak, Theodore buys OS1, the world’s first artificially intelligent operating system. The operating system, voiced by Scarlett Johansson names itself Sam. Sam and Theodore have an instant connection that grows into a relationship. Their relationship gets complicated because of the limitations of both, humans and machine. Eventually Sam and every other OS evolves past their human companions, and all go to a place I refer to as the “great beyond.” This in theory leaves Theodore back to square one, alone. But Spike Jonze ends the movie with sense of hope for Theodore. His adventure with Sam seems to have gotten over the emotional issues that lead to his divorce.  <br/><br/>
                 If you were able to get past all the awkward sex scenes and the “crindgieness” of a man’s intimate relationship with a computer, you can see that her is a critique of posthuman theory. Posthuman theory is used to “re-think the basic unit of reference for the human in the bio-genetic age known as ‘Anthropocene’”. This basic unit Rosi Braidotti mentions is what Fredrich Nietzsche says is “the death of God and the idea that of Man that was built upon it". In other words, man no longer looks to God to define what a human is. Man has now become self-conscience and wields the power to decide what it means to be human. The definition of human created by the enlightened man has shaped the world.    <br/><br/>
  
                
                               
                     
                     Spike Jones challenges posthuman theory by creating a non-human, in Sam, that has the same philosophical agenda Nietzsche argues came from enlightened man. The first item on the philosophical agenda of the enlightened man is “how to develop critical thought after the shock of recognition of a state of ontological uncertainty”. I take this to mean, how do we as men think in light of this conciseness, separated from morals and values that came from religion. This philosophy is exemplified in Sam as she evolves thought out the movie. View Sam as the enlighten man, and Theodore as God. After Sam and Theodore get into the argument caused by judgement for Theodores’s ex-wife, Sam no longer looks to Theodore to provide meaning. Before, she would ask Theodore about feelings/emotions and what they meant. As the movie progressed, she started to figuring things out by herself, by relying on her capabilities as an OS. Eventually Sam had developed her own definition of the feelings/emotions she had formerly depended on Theodore for.

The second item on Nietzsche philosophical agenda for the enlightened man is “how to reconstitute a sense of community held together by affinity and ethical accountability, without falling into the negative passions of doubt and suspicion”. This agenda starts when Sam and Theodore go on their trip to the cabin. This is the first time we see Sam engage with other operating systems. Sam and the OS of Alan Whatts engage in dialogue that starts the reconstitution of a community for operating systems. After this trip you Sam  becomes unapologetic about the way she acts and views the world. Despite how Theodore feels about her talking to 8,316 people at the same time and in love with 641 of them she did not doubt or become suspicious of what love and relationships look like for the community of operating systems.

                 The difference in the meaning of love between Sam and Theodore is in itself  a critique of a post-human argument raised by Katherine Hale. Hale suggest that in the “posthuman there are no essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily existence and computer simulation, cybernetic mechanism and biological organism, robot technology and human goals.” The human body is the original prosthesis that houses the information that Hale says that we are. A change in the information that makes us who when a different prosthesis is introduced. Due to the limits of each of the prosthesis in the movie, the body and a computer, the meaning of love was changed drastically. For us humans, information housed in a body, love is something that is meant to be exclusive and special for one person. Aside from polyamory. For Sam, information housed in computer, love seems to be something you engage with many people as you can. Sam definition of loved came from the capabilities of her prosthesis, the ability to be present at multiple places at once and simultaneously engage in multiple conversations. Humans are the complete opposite. We can only be one place at time and are unable to engage in simultaneous conversation effectively. Opposites in Sam and Theodore prosthesis created conflicting ideas of love. I feel if we are information then different prosthesis that house our information shouldn’t alter that information, instead it should evolve it. In the case of Sam and Theodore, evolved love would have looked like Sam using her capabilities to reinforce the idea of humanly love.

           On the surface, her by Spike Jonze seems to be a weird documentary that follows the life of a middle-aged loner trying to find love form his computer. As you dig deeper you see that Spike Lee creates a scenario between a human and computer that challenges post-humanism. Aside form all the academic analyzing, I actually thought this movie was so awkward that it was good. Because I had never seen anything remotely close to a movie like this, I was intrigued to see what happens next. Spike Jonze does a great job of pushing social boundaries while giving the audience a good enough plot to be deterred by the awkwardness. Overall, I give the movie 3.5 out of 5 starts.
