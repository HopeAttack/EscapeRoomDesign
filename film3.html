                    The “Last Angel of History” by John Akomfrah, is a documentary style film that aims to uncover futurism hidden in African American history and culture. Akomfrah, composes a montage of black artist, novelist, philosophers and musicians navigated by the journey of a “Data Thief.” A  Data Thief is a time traveler with an item called black box and a pair of 3D looking sunglasses. The film never explicitly explains what the two items do but, I believe the glasses are used to look beyond the illusion of reality and the black box is used to store fragments of information. The fragments of information believed to be stored in the black box are techno fossils that when put together form a code. When this code is cracked it gives keys to “your” future that is Afro-Futurism. <br/><br/>
                The first clue the Data Thief receives is “The Mothership Connection.” The “Mothership Connection” is the name of punk album created by George Clinton and his band the Parliament Funkadelic. The album cover shows George Clinton ridding in a space craft. This is a brilliant clue Akomfrah uses in the film because it is the name of an album where futuristic imaging is being used by a black artist and a “mothership connection” can be seen between the other artist mentioned with George Clinton. Sun Ra and Lee Perry, the other artist, were all black artist that used space iconography with their music. At first I thought, Akomfrah was introducing these characters to show that Afro-Futurism started with black artist simply using space images. Now, I see that Akomfrah was illustrating a one of Greg Tate’s notes found in “Kalahari’s Hopscotch”. Tate states that “All conversations about Black Futurism propels us forward-ever-backward-neveryon. All Black Futurism conjures thoughts of a Blacker and brighter African past and a bleaker yet more bodacious African today and mañana”. The idea is from Tate is shown in the film when Bernard Harris is introduced after the artist mentioned above. Bernard Harris was an astronaut that actually got to fly a spacecraft in space! The Afro-futurism conjured up from the iconography the artist of the“ mothership connection” used manifested into a black man flying a real space ship. Harris furthered this conjuring of a “Blacker and brighter African past and bleaker yet bodacious African today and manana” by taking the flag of all the African countries, that went to space, to Africa so the people could what they have accomplished together. <br/><br/>
  
                
                    
                     
                     
                     
                     
The next clue the Data Thief receives, found on a fragment stone, says “the line between social reality and science fiction is an optical illusion.” Tate explains this fragment in the film saying “the black existence and science fiction are one in the same.” By recasting American history in the light of science fiction Kodwo Eshun, a critic mentioned in the film, points out that it doesn’t get more alien-like than abducting, dematerializing, and genetically transforming a group of people. The same societal issues and circumstances aliens face in Sci-fi movies are the same as the black experience in America. Sci-Fi moves are tales about aliens as they contend with these societal forces. Almost all of the aliens found in Sci-Fi movies have some sort of adaptation or ability that allows to aid them in this fight. These abilities can come from genetic abilities or given through some sort of alien technology. Tate argues that black people have genetic abilities and alien technology of their own. He says in the in “Kalahari’s Hopscotch” that “They also knew they had invisibility, God, W.E.B Du Bios, double consciousness and the devil music on their side.” Double consciences and invisibilities are the genetic abilities black people poses.

               “Double consciences - the darker side of an already black moon-meant that there is always going to be a hidden shadow dimension to the African in America”. Black people become invisible when they are operating within this shadow dimension because White people can’t even perceive the dimension. The alien technology Black people have are instruments that are used to plays the devils tune.  
               <br/><br/>The devils tune originates from a man named Robert Johnson. Robert Johnson was a blues player from the 1930’s. Legend has it that he sold his soul to the devil and in return he got this black technology we call the Blues. The blues is the grandfather of all the black music genres such as Jazz and Hip Hop. Although the tale of Robert Johnson is just a myth, referring to African American music as the devils tune is quite fitting. Tate states “All that we call Black art and Black music and Black history and Black culture and the Black experience in America is actually an alternative reality built upon the impoverish ruins of the white supremacist imaginary that summoned into the Being”. He also says “The nightmare of American racialism and the brutal history of same blossomed a more beautiful child more radiant than the shit from which it arose”.  In light of these two quotes form “Kalahari’s Hopscotch”, the term the “devils tune” is transformed from a bargain with the devil to a response to racism from the devil in the form of white supremacist. It’s the devils tune because hardships black people endured at the hands of white supremacist created the force behind black music. 
               <br/><br/>
               The Data thief’s journey reveals that music is the key to Afro-futurism. Tate says that “ Race not space looms as the final frontier. Black people didn’t need to wait for late Twentieth century genomic science to figure out that race as we know it was a convenient social contraction of Black eternal being”. Racism and slavery are the convenient social contraction. Music is the medium through which black eternal being has always existed. In the film it talked about, how drums would be played to create rhythms as Africans carried water. These same African rhythms were used by slaves to communicate with each other. Now the rhythms are at the forefront of the final frontier when coupled with technology. A Guy Called Gerald says in the film “with technology we create the future we create through sampling and that is futurist.” Sampling is reminiscent of futuristic technology because it gives artist the ability to traverse music from any time and use it  to create something new. What was once just futuristic themes found on album covers has now transformed into the creation of the future.  
                  <br/><br/>
                  
                  Overall I can’t say that I enjoyed the film “Last Angel of History.” It did a great job of reveling futurism hidden within black culture but kind of failed to create a cohesive explanation of the futurism it reveled. No only was the central idea unclear, the visual of the film were terrible and the sounds were even worse. The film would have been so much more entertaining if the Data Thief had visually appealing technology and a more defined mission. Instead, we got gas station sunglasses and something that looked like a large wallet. I give the film a 2 out of 5.
