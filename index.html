 <blockquote > The Ark of the covenant is an legendary artifact, linked to many biblical miracles. Housed in this wooden chest is a powerful staff that was used to best ancient Egyptian pharos; A jar of gold mana that fell from the heavens everyday to feed the children of Israel: and a tablet of the ten commandments, said to have been drawn with the very finger of god. With the arc in their possession the Isrealites were able  to siege fortified cities, repel poisons animals and even stop the flow of rivers. This power artifact has finally been found after being missing for centuries. Several people have tried to get to it but it is in an underground temple that is divinely protected by Holy puzzles. We believe you have been chosen by God to best these challenges and use the Ark of The Covenant to for good. With the staff, you will have the power to challenge evil rulers. With the Jar of mana you will be able to end world hunger by causing It to rain food. Finally, with the 10 commandments. You will be able to bring world peace. It is your divine destiny to restore order to the world, are you up for the challenge
